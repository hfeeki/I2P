# To enable set router.blocklist.enable=true on configadvanced.jsp and restart.
# Add additional entries as desired, sorting not required.
# Warning - a large list will increase memory usage.
# Please do not block too broadly, it will segment and harm the network.
# Also you must update this list yourself, it is not overwritten by the update process.
# For example, http://www.bluetack.co.uk/config/splist.zip is very broad and includes Tor users, it is not recommended.
# A more reasonable list: http://www.bluetack.co.uk/config/level1.zip
