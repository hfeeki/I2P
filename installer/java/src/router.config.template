# Publish peer rankings
# If true, include the current liveliness and reliability rankings in one's published RouterInfo data
# Setting this to true will help debug the network and is especially useful while we'return still testing
# However, traffic analysis may be easier with this data published (though there's no reason to think people
# can't just fake the info in this).
# Since we're still very much < 1.0, this will be true for the current release by default.  As we get some 
# network helth information and tune the ranking algorithms, this will become false by default.  
# You, of course, can change this to either true or false whenever you'd like.  This is only read 
# on router startup though, so you need to restart the router if you change it.

# Keep message history
# This series of options can help out in debugging the network by keeping a

# This is entirely optional, but would be greatly appreciated during the 
# development phase of the network since it would allow the developers to detect 
# errors much more easily
router.keepHistory=false

# Submit message history
# This option works only if router.keepHistory is true and periodically sends 
# in the router history logs to the developers (specifically, it submits the file 
# via HTTP POST to http://i2p.net/cgi-bin/submitMessageHistory - you can see a sample of what
# one of those files looks like at http://i2p.net/~jrandom/sampleHist.txt)
# After submitting this file, it deletes the local copy (otherwise the file will grow 
# without bound - tens of MB per day)
# Again, this is entirely optional, but would be greatly appreciated as it should help 
# out the development process

# If your router is really slow, you'll need to update the following job parameters

router.jobLagWarning=8000

# if a job waits more than this amount of time (in

# if a job takes more than this amount of time (in
# milliseconds) to run, spit out a warning
router.jobRunWarning=8000

# if a job takes more than this amount of time (in
# milliseconds) to run, kill the router
router.jobRunFatal=30000

# wait until the router has been up for this long
# (in milliseconds) before honoring any fatalities
# since during startup, jobs are run sequentially 
# and CPU intensive tasks are needed
router.jobWarmupTime=600000

# Target clients
# How many concurrent clients the router should prepare for
# This, factored in with the tunnel settings, determines the size of the pools -
# too many, and your machine consumes excessive CPU and bandwidth, too few and your 
# clients take too long to startup.  
# e.g. If you are running an eepsite, an eepProxy, an irc proxy, and a squid proxy, set this to 4
router.targetClients=2

# Number of inbound tunnels per client
# This determines how many inbound tunnels will be allocated per client at a time. 
# This is a key factor in the reliability of a client receiving messages
# As above, too many and your machine gets hosed, too few and the pool is slow.  
# 2 should be sufficient - prior to 0.2.5, we have all had only 1
tunnels.numInbound=2

# Number of outbound tunnels per client
# This determines how many outbound tunnels must exist when a client is in operation.
# XXX Not currently enforced - ignore this setting
tunnels.numOutbound=2


# Depth of inbound tunnels
# This determines the length of inbound tunnels created - how many remote routers to
# include (0 means no remote routers, 3 means a total of four routers, including
# the local one, etc).  This is a key factor in the reliability and anonymity 
# provided by I2P
# Users should simply leave this as 2 for now, at least until the tunnels are more reliable (post 0.3)
tunnels.depthInbound=2

# Depth of outbound tunnels
# This determines the length of outbound tunnels created - how many remote routers to
# include (0 means no remote routers, 3 means a total of four routers, including
# the local one, etc).  This is a key factor in the reliability and anonymity 
# provided by I2P
# Users should simply leave this as 2 for now, at least until the tunnels are more reliable (post 0.3)
tunnels.depthOutbound=2

# Tunnel duration
# This determines how long tunnels we create should last for (in milliseconds).  Too
# long and they are more prone to failure, too short and people need to do more network
# database lookups.  The default of 10 minutes (600000 ms) should be used
# You should not change this setting unless you really know what you're doing
tunnels.tunnelDuration=600000

# Max waiting jobs
# If your router is getting heavily overloaded (due to slow CPU or excess network
# activity), your router's performance will seriously degrade, increasing its 
# load further and delaying any messages sent through your router.  The max waiting
# jobs configuration parameter is a throttle, saying that if there are more than
# that many 'jobs' that want to run ASAP at any given time, additional jobs may
# be summarily dropped.  That will reduce your load and cause others to reduce
# their dependence on you (further reducing your load).  The default value of 40
# should be sufficient, but may be increased if desired.  Less than 20 is not
# recommended, as certain normal events can queue up 10 or so jobs at a time
# (all of which only take a few milliseconds).  Leave this alone unless you know
# what you're doing
router.maxWaitingJobs=40

# shutdown password
# uncomment the following (after changing the value) to allow shutting down the 
# router through the web interface (using the form provided, or directly via
# http://localhost:7655/shutdown?password=thisIsASecret)
