<h3>2011-11-08: <b>0.8.11 <a href="http://www.i2p2.i2p/release-0.8.11.html">Released</a></b></h3>

<p>
The unprecedented network growth starting October 5th
has dramatically increased network congestion, especially on evenings (UTC)
and weekends. The last two releases contained a few changes that we hoped
would relieve the pressure, but unfortunately these measures have been only
modest successes. The primary issue is to limit the number of direct router
to-router connections in the network. This isn't a new problem; we've been
working on it for several years, usually with good results. However, the recent
growth pushed us over the edge once again.
</p><p>
Release 0.8.11 includes several more changes to reduce the number of router-to-router
connections and increase connection and tunnel build capacity. The goal, of course,
is to improve tunnel build success rates and general reliability. As always, there's
a few bug fixes and translation updates.
</p><p>
We welcome all our new users. Please be patient as we work to improve network
performance. Debugging congestion problems in a distributed anonymous network
is a continuing challenge. Please help improve the network
by restarting your router once the upgrade is downloaded.
