<h3>2011-01-24: <b>0.8.3 <a href="http://www.i2p2.i2p/release-0.8.3.html">Released</a></b></h3>
<p>
The 0.8.3 release contains several performance improvements, including reduction of threads and
memory usage, and faster I2CP (client-router) communication.
</p><p>
There is also new SSL router console support
(<a href="http://zzz.i2p/topics/800">instructions here</a>),
a new <a href="/configreseed">reseed configuration page</a> including HTTP proxy support for those behind restrictive firewalls,
a new <a href="/configclients#i2cp">I2CP configuration section</a> including I2CP-over-SSL support for remote clients,
a new <a href="/i2ptunnel/edit?tunnel=3">server connection limits and blacklist configuration section</a> for enhanced DoS protection,
and a new
<a href="/i2ptunnel/edit?tunnel=0">HTTP proxy jump server configuration section</a> so you may easily add alternative jump servers.
Statistics are now limited by default to reduce memory usage; the full set of statistics may be re-enabled on the
<a href="/configstats">stats configuration page</a>.
There are also bug fixes, of course, so
as usual, upgrading is recommended.
