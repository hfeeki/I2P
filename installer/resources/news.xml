<h3>2011-08-23: <b>0.8.8 <a href="http://www.i2p2.i2p/release-0.8.8.html">Released</a></b></h3>

<p>I2P release 0.8.8 enables the new hosts.txt database to speed hostname lookups
 and store additional information on hostname entries.
 It also includes improvements to speed a router's integration on startup.
 There is new code to detect and react to large clock shifts that should help
 a router recover after suspend/resume of the computer.
</p><p>
 There are new translations for Danish and Ukranian and lots of updates in other languages.
 Also included are, of course, a large collection of bug fixes, performance improvements,
 and updates to deal with the continued rapid expansion of the network.

Please help grow the network.
