<h4><ul><li>2010-06-07: <b>0.7.14 <a href="http://www.i2p2.i2p/release-0.7.14.html">Released</a></b></li></ul></h4>
<p>
The 0.7.14 release contains the usual collection of bug fixes and performance tweaks.
There are also some i2psnark improvements and more fixes for plugins.
Upgrading is recommended.
</p><p>
Important note: Due to a bug in 0.7.13 and earlier releases, clicking 'Download 0.7.14 Update'
in your router console summary bar, when you have the summary bar refresh enabled,
may result in multiple downloads of the update. Please disable the summary bar refresh
before clicking the download button.
If your update policy is set to 'Download and Verify Only' (the default) then
you should not have a problem, the router will download the file once.
