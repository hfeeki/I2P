<p>
0.7.9 fixes several longstanding bugs causing message corruption.
We are hopeful that network performance will improve once it is widely deployed.
There are other changes that should help router reachability and tunnel build success rates.
The release also includes additional translation support, and a full Russian translation by "forget"
which was sponsored by "russiansponsor".
</p><p>
There are more changes to reduce memory and CPU usage,
and other bug fixes.
Upgrading is recommended.
As a reminder to those still using port 8887,
please help those who are vulnerable to blocking by changing UDP to a random port on
<a href="config.jsp">the network configuration page</a>
and adjusting your firewall if necessary.

developers feedback on <a href="irc://127.0.0.1:6668/i2p">IRC #i2p</a> or <a href="http://forum.i2p">forum.i2p</a>
