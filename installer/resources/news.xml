<h4><ul><li>2009-12-08: <b>0.7.8 <a href="http://www.i2p2.i2p/release-0.7.8.html">Released</a></b></li></ul></h4>
<p>
The 9th I2P release for 2009,
0.7.8, contains initial support for router console translations, and
changes to the floodfill system which lay the foundation for supporting large growth in the network.
</p><p>
To prevent easy blocking of I2P by malicious firewalls, the release randomizes the I2P port for new installs.
For existing installs, please help those who are vulnerable to blocking by changing UDP to a random port on
<a href="config.jsp">the network configuration page</a>
and adjusting your firewall if necessary.
Say goodbye to port 8887!
</p><p>
The release also contains more changes to reduce memory and CPU usage,
and a large assortment of bug fixes.
Upgrading is recommended.
We especially encourage those of you still running release 0.7.6 or earlier to upgrade as soon as possible.
Please give the
developers feedback on IRC #i2p or <a href="http://forum.i2p">forum.i2p</a>
and <a href="http://www.i2p2.i2p/getinvolved.html">get involved</a>
or <a href="http://www.i2p2.i2p/donate.html">donate</a>!
We are also looking for help on new and existing translations.
Please volunteer on IRC #i2p.
