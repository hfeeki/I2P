The 0.7.11 release fixes several issues, some related to clocks, which prevented new routers from quickly integrating into the network.
It also fixes the installer for 64-bit Windows.
The release includes an
update to <a href="http://old.nabble.com/jetty-5.1.15,-6.1.18-and-7.0.0.M2-td23652819.html">Jetty 5.1.15</a>
to fix <a href="http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/402580">this vulnerability</a>.
</p><p>
As usual, the release contains more anonymity and performance improvements,
and an assortment of bug fixes.
Upgrading is recommended.

We already have more big improvements in development for the next two releases.
