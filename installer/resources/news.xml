<h3>2011-10-11: <b>0.8.9 <a href="http://www.i2p2.i2p/release-0.8.9.html">Released</a></b></h3>

<p>
The 0.8.9 release has several performance improvements, and many changes to handle
the continued rapid growth of the network. It uses a new iterative method for
Kademlia network database lookups that should be more reliable and efficient.
There are also several improvements to our SSU (UDP) transport protocol that
should help reliability and efficiency. We have made several changes to
improve tunnel build success rates. And, of course, there are lots of bug
fixes and translation updates.
</p><p>
The network has grown quite rapidly in recent weeks, and that's great news,
but it has caused some instability. We welcome all our new users and we
ask you to be patient as we make improvements to the software.
