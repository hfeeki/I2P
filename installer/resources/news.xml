<h4><ul><li>2010-01-22: <b>0.7.10 <a href="http://www.i2p2.i2p/release-0.7.10.html">Released</a></b></li></ul></h4>

0.7.10 closes some recently-discovered vulnerabilities related to the
way routers communicate with floodfill peers.
Network database stores and verifies are moved from exploratory to client tunnels, and are encrypted.
</p><p>
Also, to improve anonymity, router's fast peer set is now limited to a maximum of 30.
The release also fixes a bug causing Windows installs to fail when the install or user path
contained a "\r" or "\n".
Upgrading is recommended.
