<h4><ul><li>2010-03-15: <b>0.7.12 <a href="http://www.i2p2.i2p/release-0.7.12.html">Released</a></b></li></ul></h4>
<p>
The 0.7.12 release contains support for user-generated plugins. These plugins may contain console web applications,
themes, translations, or standalone programs.
Some plugins are available for testing at
<a href="http://i2pbote.i2p/">i2pbote.i2p</a>
and
<a href="http://stats.i2p/i2p/plugins/">stats.i2p</a>.
We are hopeful this support will enable rapid development of innovative i2p applications.
</p><p>
The release fixes the blank-page bug when an eepsite is not reachable,
and also improves handling of clock skews and IP changes.
It adds support for a new, smaller tunnel build message,
that will be tested in this release and enabled in the next release.
</p><p>
As usual, the release contains more anonymity and performance improvements,
translation updates, and an assortment of other bug fixes.
Upgrading is recommended.

The last 6 months of development have dramatically increased the performance and capacity of the network.
