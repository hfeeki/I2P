 <h1>Welcome to your eepsite</h1>

 <p>This is your eepsite - simply edit the files under ./eepsite/docroot/ 
 and they'll be reachable.  The 'key' to your eepsite that you need to
 give to other people is shown on the I2PTunnel configuration
 <a href="http://localhost:7657/i2ptunnel/">configuration page</a>). </p>
 <p>
 If you have any standard java web applications (.war files) such as 
 <a href="http://wiki.blojsom.com/wiki/display/blojsom/About%2Bblojsom">blojsom</a>
 or <a href="http://snipsnap.org/space/start">SnipSnap</a>, simply drop their .war
 file into ./eepsite/webapps/ and they'll be reachable at 
 http://$yourEeepsite/warFileName/</p>
 
 <p>You can also reach your eepsite locally through 
 <a href="http://localhost:7658/">http://localhost:7658/</a>.  If you 
 want to change the port number, edit the file ./eepsite/jetty.xml and 
 update the I2PTunnel configuration accordingly.</p>
