I2P source installation instructions

Prerequisites to build from source:
	Java SDK (preferably Sun) 1.5.0 or higher (1.6 recommended)
	The SDK must have Pack200 support (java.util.jar.Pack200)
	Apache Ant 1.7.0 or higher
	Optional, For multilanguage support: The xgettext, msgfmt, and msgmerge tools installed
	from the GNU gettext package http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/

To build and install I2P from source, you must first build
and package up the appropriate installer by running:

  ant pkg


This will produce a few key files:
* install.jar:    the GUI and console installer
* i2pinstall.exe: the GUI and console installer wrapped for cross-platform execution
* i2pupdate.zip:  the update package

From there, you can run the headless (console mode) installer:
  java -jar i2pinstall.exe -console

Or run the GUI installer:
  java -jar i2pinstall.exe

Or move the update file into an existing installation directory and restart.
