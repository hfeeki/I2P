I2P source installation instructions

To build and install I2P from source, you must first build
and package up the appropriate installer by running:

  ant pkg

This will produce a few key files:
* install.jar:    the GUI and console installer
* i2pinstall.exe: the GUI and console installer wrapped for cross-platform execution
* i2pupdate.zip:  the update package

From there, you can run the headless (console mode) installer:
  java -jar i2pinstall.exe -console

Or run the GUI installer:
  java -jar i2pinstall.exe

Or move the update file into an existing installation directory and restart.

You will need to have ant installed from http://ant.apache.org/
(1.7.0 or newer)
