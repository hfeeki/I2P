I2P source installation instructions

To build and install I2P from source, you must first build
and package up the appropriate installer by running:

  ant dist

This will produce a few key files:
* i2p.tar.bz2:   the headless installation
* install.jar:   the GUI installer
* i2pupdate.zip: the update package

From there, you can follow the headless installation instructions
with the headless installer, run the GUI installer, or deploy
the update into an existing installation.

You will need to have ant installed from http://ant.apache.org/
(1.5 or newer)
