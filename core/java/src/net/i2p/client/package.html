<p>Implements the base I2P SDK for developing applications that communicate 
through I2P.</p>

<p>When a client application wants to communicate over I2P, the first thing it 
needs to do is get a {@link net.i2p.client.I2PClient} from the 
{@link net.i2p.client.I2PClientFactory}.  If it does not already have a {@link 
net.i2p.data.Destination}, it must generate one with the {@link 
net.i2p.client.I2PClient#createDestination} before proceeding.  Once it has
one, it then creates an {@link net.i2p.client.I2PSession} which serves as the
bridge to the I2P network, allowing it to send messages (via 
{@link net.i2p.client.I2PSession#sendMessage}) and receive messages (via 
{@link net.i2p.client.I2PSession#receiveMessage}).  In addition, the client 
receives asynchronous notification of network activity by providing an implementation 
of {@link net.i2p.client.I2PSessionListener}. </p>

<p>A simple example of how these base client classes can be used is the 
{@link net.i2p.client.ATalk} application.  It isn't really useful, but it is 
heavily documented code.</p>

<p>This client package provides the basic necessity for communicating over I2P,
but there are three other subpackages that are helpful.  Specifically:<ul>
<li>{@link net.i2p.client.datagram} - for applications that want their messages
    to be both authenticated and repliable</li>
<li>{@link net.i2p.client.naming} - for applications that want to resolve 
    readable names into {@link net.i2p.data.Destination}s</li>
<li>{@link net.i2p.client.streaming} - for applications that want to use 
    a streaming API to provide reliable in order message delivery (<b>note</b>:
    the streaming library is packaged seperate from the main SDK - in the 
    ministreaming.jar)</li>
</ul></p>

<p>The {@link net.i2p.client.I2PSession} implementation itself communicates with
the I2P router by the I2CP (the client protocol).  This is done over a 
bidirectional TCP socket and never sends any private keys - all end to end 
encryption is done transparently within the client's {@link net.i2p.client.I2PSession} 
itself.  Periodically the router will ask the client to authorize a new set of
tunnels to be allocated to the client, which the client can accept by sending a
{@link net.i2p.data.LeaseSet} signed by the {@link net.i2p.data.Destination}.  In
addition, the router may on occation provide the client with an updated clock 
offset so that the client can stay in sync with the network (even if the host
computer's clock is off).</p>
