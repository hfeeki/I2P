<h3>Huh? what addressbook?</h3>
<p>
The addressbook application is part of your i2p installation. It regularly updates your hosts.txt file
from distributed sources. It keeps your hosts.txt up to date, so it can automatically add
eepsites announced on other sites if you subscribe to those sites' addressbooks.
</p>
<p>
(To speak the truth: In its default configuration the addressbook does not poll
additional sites, but www.i2p2.i2p only. Subscribing to additional sites is an easy task,
just add them to your <a href="subscriptions.jsp">subscriptions</a> file.)
</p>
<p>If you have questions about naming in i2p, there is an excellent <a href="http://forum.i2p.net/viewtopic.php?t=134">introduction</a>
from duck in the forum.</p>
<h3>How does the addressbook work?</h3>
<p>The addressbook application regularly (normally once per hour) polls your subscriptions and merges their content
into your so-called router addressbook (normally your plain hosts.txt). Then it merges your so-called master addressbook (normally
your userhosts.txt) into the router addressbook as well. If configured, the router addressbook is now written to the published addressbook, 
which is a publicly available copy of your hosts.txt somewhere in your eepsite's document root.
</p><p>
The router also uses a private addressbook (privatehosts.txt, not shown in the picture), which is not merged or published.
Hosts in the private addressbook can be accessed by you but their addresses are never distributed to others.
The private addressbook can also be used for aliases of hosts in your other addressbooks.
