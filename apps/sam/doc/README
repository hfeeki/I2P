SAM - Simple Anonymous Messaging - is a protocol which allows
I2P applications to access the I2P network via an unencrypted
TCP socket connection.

Interim SAM protocol specification can be found at:
http://drupal.i2p.net/node/view/144

At time of first writing this README, an implementation of the SAM
server has been implemented in Jython (www.jython.org).

You can find the server code, and build files, in the ../jython
directory.

A python client implementation, containing demo functions,
can be found in the ../python directory.

I2P developers are strongly encouraged to create SAM
client implementations in other languages, most importantly,
popular portable languages like C/C++, Perl and Ruby.

The 'code.leo' file in this directory is used by the Leo
code editor (http://leo.sf.net), to manage the source in a
flexible tree format. While I can't insist on it, I'd
massively appreciate it if you could use this editor when
making additions and changes to the files herein, because
it will save me a lot of maintenance effort.
