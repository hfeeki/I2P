Known Bugs:
  * TunnelServer may crash the I2P router in the following
    ways when a large file is downloaded:

    * Out of memory exception (for large files)
    * Mysterious router death with no errors in the router logs
      (more recently)
    * BUG! in SAM proxy
      See http://oregonstate.edu/~barnesc/temp/sam_crash.txt
  * A small number of datagram packets sent are lost (even in a local
    loopback).  This is apparently a bug in I2P.
  * Errors raised for sockets are non entirely consistent.
    See todo.txt for how to fix this.
  * A session does not close until a program exits.
    This should be fine once I2P is patched to allow multiple
    programs to use a single session at once.
  * i2p.router.start() does not work.
