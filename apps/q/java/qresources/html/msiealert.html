            <p>We have blocked the connection to protect your anonymity.
              </p>
            <p>As a matter of policy, Q does not support QSite browsing via Microsoft
               Internet Explorer (MSIE), because of that browser's abysmal track record with
               regard to security. If we did allow you to browse Q via MSIE, it would
               be easy for a malicious QSite author to embed hostile content which 
               undermines your computer's security and compromises your anonymity.
               </p>
             <p>If you want to surf I2P QSites, you'll need to use a more secure web
                browser such as <a href="http://www.mozilla.org">Mozilla or Firefox</a>.
