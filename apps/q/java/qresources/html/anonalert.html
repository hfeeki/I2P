            <p>You are attempting to view a QSite via an unprotected link.
              </p>
            <p>We have blocked the connection to protect your anonymity. If we don't
              do this, then a malicious QSite author can insert content into the QSite
              which triggers oubound hits to arbitrary servers on the mainstream web,
              which in turn can easily reveal a lot of personal information about you
              and the QSite you are accessing.
              </p>
            <p>If you want to browse QSites with your web browser with greater safety,
              you'll have to follow these simple steps:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>Edit your I2P <code>hosts.txt</code> file and add the following entry
                  (all on one line):
                  <blockquote><code><textarea rows=5 cols=50>q.i2p=<tmpl_var dest></textarea></code><blockquote>
                  (and make sure you do NOT reveal this entry to anyone else)
                  </li>
                <li>Configure one of your web browsers to use the proxy server:
                  <blockquote><code>localhost:4444</code></blockquote>
                  (or whatever address you have configured your I2P EEProxy to listen on,
                  if you've changed it)<br><br>
                  </li>
                <li>Start up the browser you have just configured, and enter the web address:
                  <blockquote><code>http://q.i2p</code></blockquote>
                  </li>
              </ol>
            <p>Even if you do this, you still won't have a 100% guarantee of anonymity, since
               a malicious QSite author can send code to your browser which exploits a vulnerability
               in the browser to compromise your anonymity (eg, accessing third party cookies, executing
               arbitrary code, accessing your local filesystem, uploading compromising information
               about you to hostile I2P EEPsites etc). But you can relax (somewhat) in the knowledge
               that such attacks are much more difficult, particularly if you use a decent web browser.
               </p>
            <p>Thank you for your co-operation. We wish you happy and safe browsing.
