  This is a template for Pants pbuilds. Pbuilds use standard Apache Ant syntax.
  For each target in the Public Interface section you must provide either an
  implementation or a stub. You may also add your own custom tasks and
  properties to this file. Be careful that none of your custom properties'
  names clash with the properties defined in pants/build.xml.

	<!--
	  When this target is called, the pbuild's sources and/or binaries have
	  already been extracted/copied by Pants into the pbuild's working/
	  subdirectory. This target must prepare those sources and/or binaries in
	  the working/ subdirectory into deployable form, for example by building
	  all necessary classes and jar files.
	  
	  This target must not create or modify any files outside the pbuild's
	  working/ subdirectory. (An automatic sandboxing mechanism should be added
	  to Pants at some point.) It is however acceptable for a task called by
	  'builddep' to modify files outside of this pbuild's working/ directory.

	<target name="build" depends="builddep" />

	<!--
	  Use this to call targets from other pbuilds, Ant buildfiles, Makefiles,
	  etc. which perform tasks this pbuild's 'build' target depends on. If other
	  pbuilds are called here, they must be called through the Pants interface
	  or else it may leave Pants in an inconsistent state.
	  
	  Most pbuilds probably won't need to implement this target.

	<target name="builddep" />

	<!--
	  This target must undo the actions performed by the 'build' target.

	<!--
	  If the 'builddep' target is implemented, this target must be implemented
	  to undo its actions.
	-->
	<target name="depclean" />

	<!--
	  This target must copy all deployable files generated by the 'build' target
	  into the pbuild's dist/ subdirectory (for use by other pbuilds or Ant
	  processes) or to their final deployment locations outside the pants/
	  directory hierarchy. Note that the latter may require the user to gain
	  superuser/admin privileges.
	-->
	<target name="dist" depends="build" />

	<!--
	  This target must remove all files from the pbuild's dist/ subdirectory
	  and final deployment locations, reversing the actions of the 'dist'
	  target. Note that removal of files from their final deployment locations
	  may require the user to gain superuser/admin privileges.
