<p>Implements a TCP-like (reliable, authenticated, in order) set of sockets for 
communicating over the IP-like (unreliable, unauthenticated, unordered) I2P
messages.</p>

<p>When an application wants to use streams, it must fetch an {@link
net.i2p.client.streaming.I2PSocketManager} from the {@link 
net.i2p.client.streaming.I2PSocketManagerFactory}, which in turn builds its own
{@link net.i2p.client.I2PSession} internally.  All communication over that 
{@link net.i2p.client.I2PSession} is handled by the {@link 
net.i2p.client.streaming.I2PSocketManager}, as it imposes its own formatting on
the raw messages sent and received.  If an application wants to receive streams
from other clients on the network, it should access the blocking {@link
net.i2p.client.streaming.I2PServerSocket#accept} method, which will provide an
{@link net.i2p.client.streaming.I2PSocket} when a new one is available.  If an
application wants to create a new stream to a peer, it should do so with the
appropriate {@link net.i2p.client.streaming.I2PSocketManager#connect} call.</p>
