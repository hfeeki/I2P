HIGH PRIORITY:
- Allow desktopgui to start, stop and restart I2P. - DONE
- Internationalisation
- Correct logging system
UNKNOWN:
- API to allow applications to add themselves to the menu?
    * registerApplication(); -- should return a positive number on success, -1 on failure
    * unregisterApplication(int); -- should return nothing (or bool for success?), and the parameter should be the number given when registering the application
- Fetch I2P localhost from the core I2P application? 
- Use I2PAppContext::appDir (something like that) for desktopgui data.
- Consider SWT as option
    * Check core/java/src/net/i2p/util/FileUtil.java for dynamic jar loading
    * Possible logic:
        - First try to load SWT (has the most options and is not ugly)
        - Then load AWT
- Access router.jar from other JVM? Is this possible? -- no: use I2CP with auth (not ready yet)
- Start desktopgui with another user than the user starting I2P (required for daemon usage).
