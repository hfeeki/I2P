<p>Perhaps the best introduction to Syndie can be found <a
href="threads.jsp?post=ovpBy2mpO1CQ7deYhQ1cDGAwI6pQzLbWOm1Sdd0W06c=/1132012800001">in
Syndie itself</a>.</p>

<p>Updates can be found by filtering for the <a
href="threads.jsp?tags=syndie.intro">syndie.intro</a> tag (if you only want to
receive posts that <a
href="threads.jsp?author=ovpBy2mpO1CQ7deYhQ1cDGAwI6pQzLbWOm1Sdd0W06c=">jrandom</a>
 made with that tag, that can be <a
href="threads.jsp?tags=syndie.intro&author=ovpBy2mpO1CQ7deYhQ1cDGAwI6pQzLbWOm1Sdd0W06c=">achieved</a>
as well).</p>

<p>If you have any questions or problems with Syndie, just post them and
syndicate it up to <a href="http://syndiemedia.i2p/">syndiemedia.i2p</a> (which should show up as the default archive
on new installs).  You can also use the <a href="http://forum.i2p.net/">I2P
forums</a> if you're having trouble getting Syndie to work, and people are
almost always around on the <a href="http://forum.i2p.net/viewtopic.php?t=952">#i2p irc
channel</a>.</p>
