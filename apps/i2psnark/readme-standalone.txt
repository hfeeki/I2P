To run I2PSnark from the command line, run "java -jar lib/i2psnark.jar", but
to run it with the web UI, run "java -jar launch-i2psnark.jar".  I2PSnark is
GPL'ed software, based on Snark (http://www.klomp.org/) to run on top of I2P
(http://www.i2p.net/) within a webserver (such as the bundled Jetty from
http://jetty.mortbay.org/).  For more information about I2PSnark, get in touch
with the folks at http://forum.i2p.net/
