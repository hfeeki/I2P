This directory is intended for tests which are useful for testing 
I2P, but don't test any of the I2P components directly. Instead,
tests are run on "application" level (TCP, IRC, HTTP etc.).

IOW: These tests may be useful for any other project that allows 
tunneling of "normal" protocols, not only I2P.
