Headless I2P installation instructions

1) java -jar i2pinstall.exe -console       (you've already done this)

This will run the installer in text mode, including running the postinstall.sh
script, which will start the router and launch a browser.

If you do not have an X server running, the browser launch will fail, and
you may use:
  lynx http://localhost:7657/index.jsp
to configure the router.

If you're having trouble, swing by http://forum.i2p2.de/, check the
website at http://www.i2p2.de/, or get on irc://irc.freenode.net/#i2p

To run I2P explicitly:
   (*nix): sh i2prouter start
   (win*): I2P.exe

To stop the router (gracefully):
   lynx http://localhost:7657/configservice.jsp ("Shutdown gracefully")

To stop the router (immediately):
   sh i2prouter stop

To uninstall I2P:
   rm -rf $i2pInstallDir
